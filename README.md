# Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic Tac Toe game with a graphical interface. 

# Functionality
The program allows you to play Tic Tac Toe. Two users take turns assigning their marker on the board. When having a winner by having three markers in line, the program announces which player won and, in the event of a tie, shows a tie. The score of the current match is saved on a .txt file. After the game anounces the event (winner or tie) it resets the board, score, and markers. 

# How to run the program
To run the program, you need to have installed Python 3 and pygame V2. After having them installed, have all the files on the same directory and run the next line on the terminal.
```
python3 main.py
```
